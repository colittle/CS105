Football is my favorite sport because of the thrill and wild plays that can happen. My favorite teams are the Cardinals and the Chiefs. Another aspect I love about it is fantasy football. My current team is 3-0 and hopefully I can pull off the championship. The last two years have been dreadfull because I finish with the best record and make it to the championship, but have lost both times there. Third time is the charm!
